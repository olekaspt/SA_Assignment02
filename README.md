# SA_Assignment02


This is an exercise in how to think about task estimation.  

You will estimate both of the codingame problems below.  And then you will solve on the problems (You pick one).

Problem 1
https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-gift 

Problem 2
https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/super-computer
<the second problem I think is the harder one, as there is not testcase for one of the use cases>

The problem to solve should only take about an two hours max with two people. Please do not google the solution (at least initially), as I wanted to pick something that was quick and easy, had built-in testcases and such.  If you spend more than 2 hours (individually or group), then do look for inspiration and attribute correctly.

The solution MUST be done in C++, C#, or Java

Part 1) 
Pick either problem 1 or 2.  And solve the problem on your own without googling or getting past solutions initially.  At least until 2 hour mark, and then you can google a solution.
Questions to answer:
* Were you able to solve the problem?  Did you have to get inspiration?  If yes, where did you get inspiration from?
* How well was your estimates (answer for each partner)?
* Did you account for defect injection (the pure optimist problem)?  Reminder Defect Injection is where you will inject a bug per X Lines of Code.
* The way CodeInGame works is it gives you the UnitTests upfront.  How long would it have taken you to make UnitTests?  
* For the UnitTests that were provided, would you have come up with them on your own?

For you report.
* PDF report for Part 1
  * Screenshots of the green submit check mark
  * Answers to questions posed in Part 1
  * Code copied to file, so we can confirm no sharing of solutions.
