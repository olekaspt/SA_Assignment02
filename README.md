This should be done in a team of two

This is an exercise in how to think about task estimation.  

You will estimate both of the codingame problems below.  And then you will solve on the problems (You pick one).

Problem 1
https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-gift 
Problem 2
https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/super-computer
<the second problem I think is the harder one, as there is not testcase for one of the use cases>

The problem to solve should only take about an two hours max with two people. Please do not google the solution (at least initially), as I wanted to pick something that was quick and easy, had built-in testcases and such.  If you spend more than 2 hours (individually or group), then do look for inspiration and attribute correctly.

The solution MUST be done in C++, C#, or Java

Part 1)
I want you setup two Gannt charts (using the proposed spreadsheet template).  For both of these charts, you will be solving problem 1 and 2.  (If you are in a group of 3, assume there is a Problem 3 in equivilant scope of work as Problem 2).

In the first one, you will work sequentially, solve problem 1 before you solve problem 2.  And the second one you can solve both problems sequentially.

For the estimates, of this work, assume you can do 2 hours of pure effort per day.  And also assume you can't google the solution.

NOTE : typicall in industry we assume 4 hours of pure effort is one calendar day. But the above assumption is as a student with other obligations you can put only 2 hours towards this class.

Part 2)
Ok using your gannt Chart, letâ€™s play some hypothetical.  Make a copy of your spreadsheet worksheet and make a copy of it, and label it hypothetical.

Letâ€™s pretend we need work with Application Engineer (QA) to test our code after we believe it complete.  Think of codingame tests as UnitTest\Automated tests.  But a QA person needs to do manual testing (exploration testing).  And trust me QA always find bugs (or at least working as designed features ðŸ˜Š).
Add them to the schedule, with the following constraints.
â€¢	They will test the code only after all partners are done.
â€¢	QA will require at least 8 hours pure effort to test the code initially.
â€¢	You will require at least 4 hours to fix\address bugs.
â€¢	QA will require another 4 hours to test the code after bugs have been fixed.
â€¢	As efficiently possible, schedule the developer work on second problem while QA is testing the first problem.  
â€¢	And then have QA test the second problem.

Part 3) 
Pick either problem 1 or 2.  And solve the problem on your own without googling or getting past solutions.  At least until 2 hour mark, and then you can google a solution.
Questions to answer:
* Were you able to solve the problem?  Did you have to get inspiration?  If yes, where did you get inspiration from?
* How well was your estimates (answer for each partner)?
* Did you account for defect injection (the pure optimist problem)?  Reminder Defect Injection is where you will inject a bug per X Lines of Code.
* The way CodeInGame works is it gives you the UnitTests upfront.  How long would it have taken you to make UnitTests?  
* Did some of the UnitTests that were provided, would you have come up with them on your own?

For you report.
* One spreadsheet with multiple sheets.  Sheet 1 is for Pt1, Sheet 2 is for Pt 2.
* PDF report for Part 3
  * Screenshots of the green submit check mark
  * Answers to questions posed in Part 3
  * Code copied to file, so we can confirm no sharing of solutions.
